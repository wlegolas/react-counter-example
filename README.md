# üöÄ About this project

This repository contains a React application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite App](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) using the `react-ts` template.

To build this project I followed the **Feature Folder** structure where the main goal is to centralize inside the `features` folder the implementation by context. In this article [Evolution of a React folder structure and why to group by features right away](https://profy.dev/article/react-folder-structure) you can get more information about this architecture.

In this project there are two `features`:

- **app**: This feature provides all things related to the application.
- **counter**: This feature provides all mechanism to interact with the Counter.
